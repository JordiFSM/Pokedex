Description
This project is a Pokédex created using React with Tailwind CSS, utilizing the PokéAPI. It features lazy loading, filtered searches, sorting based on the API, and more.


Code scaffolding
You can generate new components using various libraries and tools available for React. For example, to generate a new component, you can use npx with libraries like create-react-component, generate-react-component, or similar.

Installation
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install dependencies, run 'npm i'. This will install all the necessary packages and dependencies required for the project to run smoothly.

Development server
To start the development server, run 'npm run dev'. This will launch the application in development mode. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits to the source code.

Build
